# Kiwi Browser for Android

Kiwi is based on Chromium, the engine that powers the most popular browser
in the world so you won't loose your habits.

We do not provide support or help on how to use or build the source-code.

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster,
and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

The project's web site is https://www.chromium.org.

Documentation in the source is rooted in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).
